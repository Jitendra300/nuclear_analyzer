Main Repo For Stimulation , Running on Render

# Problem:
Find suitable places in India where a nuclear plant can be built considering various parameters like Water resources, Infrastructure, Environment, and etc.

# Approch Used:
We are building a web app where a user can click on a specific place on Indian map and get data whether we can have a Neural plant or not on that specific place or surrounding places [radius of 10km].

# Tools Used:
    * Flask
    * OSM [Open Street Map] API
    * Leaflet.js
    * Render [for hosting]

# Why those Tools:

## Flask:
Flask is easy to work with especially static websites like ours

## OSM:
OSM has rich collection of databases of all sorts be it checking nearby water bodies, highways, forests or any environment.

## Leaflet.js
It has interactive maps which are useful for our project.

## Render
Render is here used for hosting [that too free hosting, afterall who doesn't like free hosting ;) ]

# Running (Locally):
    git clone "https://github.com/Jitendra300/nuclear_analyzer.git"
    cd nuclear_analyzer
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py

    Then open your webbrowser and type __localhost:5000__.

    There is our website, neat and clean. Looking for being explored.

# Thank You
